#Breakout

This is my own simple implementation of the famous atari Breakout game.

##To Run the Game:

First download the project and unzip it.
Then cd into the unzipped "Breakout" folder, then compile and run the program with
the following commands.

Compile:
```javac -cp acm.jar breakout.java```

Run:
```java -cp .:acm.jar Breakout```
